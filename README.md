# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is a web-based application that helps visualize different sorting algorithms. With this tool, you can see how sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort work step-by-step on a randomly generated array.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- **Interactive Controls**: Generate a random array and select sorting algorithms to see step-by-step sorting.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts to various screen sizes using Bootstrap for layout.
- **Animated Visualization**: Bars update dynamically to show the sorting process in real time.


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```

2. **Open the project**:
   Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: Markup and styling of the application.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive layout and styling.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the core logic for sorting algorithms and dynamic visualization.

## Usage

1. **Select a Sorting Algorithm**: Choose from the dropdown menu of available sorting algorithms.
2. **Generate New Array**: Click the “Generate Array” button to create a new set of bars.
3. **Sort**: Click the “Sort” button to visualize the selected sorting algorithm in action.

## Available Sorting Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: Finds the smallest element in the array and places it at the start.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by comparing elements.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits and merges the array.
- **Quick Sort**: Divides the array around a pivot and sorts each partition.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the app.
- **styles.css**: Custom CSS for styling the sorting bars and layout.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file that handles sorting algorithms and DOM manipulation.

## Contributing
